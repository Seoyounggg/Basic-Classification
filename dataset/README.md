There are four different kinds of ramens and they are labeled as below.

0. 오징어짬뽕
1. 비빔면
2. 짜왕
3. 무파마

We took 200 pictures of each ramen and divided 40 of them as test set by using split_data.py which is created by yanghoJI

So we trained 160 pictures for each ramen, and the remaining are used for test.
