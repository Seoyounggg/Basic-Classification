There are four different types of ramens and each was labeled as below.

0. 오징어짬뽕(Cham-pong Noodle Soup)
1. 비빔면(Korean bibim-ramen noodles)
2. 짜왕(Jjawang Jjajangmyeon Ramen)
3. 무파마(Spicy Vegetable Noodle Soup)

We took 200 pictures of each ramen and divided 40 of them as test set by using split_data.py which was created by yanghoJI

So we trained 160 pictures for each ramen, and the remaining were used for test.
